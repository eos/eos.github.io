I have just released version 0.3.2, which you can find [here](https://github.com/eos/eos/releases/v0.3.2).

Changes since version 0.3.1 include:

 - changing existing SignalPDFs to adhere to the LHCb angular conventons where possible;
 - adding initial formulas for the LCSR of the B&rarr; &pi; form factor f<sub>0</sub>;
 - adding support for forward-folded multivariate Gaussian constraints through a response matrix;
 - adding the eos-analysis script to replace the current C++ clients in the long run;
 - building Python binaries for CPython 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 for linux-x86_64-gnu;
 - disabling the GSL default error handler when loading libeos.so;
 - fixing syntax problems in the documentation.

Contributors of these changes are:
 - Nico Gubernari
 - Domagoj Leljak
 - M&eacute;ril Reboud
